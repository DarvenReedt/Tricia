  This is not a real projekt at all. I can't work any more, i've got since an operation on my brain epilepsy and must stay at home. That is very boring. I'll like to play with the Blender 3D editor. So i come on this idea to try build more and more elements (houses, buildings streets, plants etc.) for a town, called Tricia, and put them at the end together. I don't plan to build a town at once, i plan to make part for part and look at the end what it is.

  Every 3D artist believe it's impossible to build a 3D town at my own, and they're right.
So i don't try to do this, it is more a playing with the Blender programm and look what's happend.

  i'am new on Github and need help to use it, i want to use it a little bit as an cloud and a place to get help from specialistes for Blender and Godot, i want to use it to walk around in Tricia. That is the crazest part, of all.
  
  The first branch is to collect ideas, sketches and researches for the elements. 
The second part is for the first tries of the objects in Blender files.
